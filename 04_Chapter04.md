## Problem:

Pele had already achieved some success at Bauru Athletic Club, but he knew that if he wanted to take his career to the next level, he needed to play for one of Brazil's top football clubs. He needed to find a way to catch the attention of these clubs and secure a spot on their teams.

Pele jumped at the opportunity, knowing it was a chance to learn from some of Brazil's best players and showcase his skills to a global audience.

## Code Sample:

```
// Finding success at Bauru Athletic Club
const goalsScored = 36;
const matchesPlayed = 27;

const goalsPerMatch = goalsScored / matchesPlayed;
console.log(`Pele's goals per match at Bauru Athletic Club: ${goalsPerMatch}`);

// Catching the attention of Santos FC
const scouts = ['Jose', 'Carlos', 'Roberto'];
const peleStats = {
  goalsScored: 58,
  assists: 17,
  successfulDribbles: 79,
  successfulPasses: 92
};

const impressScouts = (scouts, stats) => {
  for (let scout of scouts) {
    console.log(`${scout} watched Pele play and was impressed with his stats!`);
  }
  
  if (stats.goalsScored >= 50 && stats.assists >= 15 && stats.successfulDribbles >= 70 && stats.successfulPasses >= 90) {
    console.log(`As a result, Santos FC offered Pele a spot on their team!`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Pele will need to continue improving his skills before he catches the eye of a top club.`);
  }
}

impressScouts(scouts, peleStats);
