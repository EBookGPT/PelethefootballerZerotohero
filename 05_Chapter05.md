## Pele's Journey to the World Cup
Pele's selection to the Brazilian national team for the 1958 World Cup was not without controversy. As Sá explains, "Many older, more experienced players were left out of the squad in favor of the young Pele. At the time, it seemed like a risky move, but it was one that certainly paid off."

Despite initial doubts, Pele quickly proved himself to be a star on the international stage, scoring six goals in the tournament, including a hat-trick in the semifinal against France. His performances helped Brazil to capture their first World Cup championship, and Pele became the youngest player to ever score in a World Cup final.

Pele's dominance at the World Cup also put him on the radar of top European clubs, who were eager to secure his services for their own teams. However, Pele remained loyal to Santos FC, the club that had given him his start and where he had experienced so much success.
