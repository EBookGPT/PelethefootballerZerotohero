# Chapter 8: Personal Life and Celebrity Status

Congratulations, dear reader, on reaching the eighth chapter of Pele the footballer's journey from zero to hero. In this chapter, we will discuss the personal life and celebrity status of one of the greatest football players the world has ever seen.

After winning the 1958 World Cup at the age of 17, Pele became an overnight sensation. He had captured the hearts of the Brazilian people, and his fame only continued to grow as he achieved further success on the field.

Off the field, Pele enjoyed a lavish lifestyle that came with his celebrity status. He was the face of many brands and products, and he traveled the world extensively to promote them. He also became a sought-after public speaker, sharing his insights on football and his life with millions of people worldwide.

Despite his fame and fortune, Pele remained grounded and continued to value family above all else. He married his girlfriend, Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi, in 1966, and the couple went on to have three children together.

In this chapter, we will delve into the personal life of Pele, exploring his relationships with family, friends, and the public. We will also explore the unique challenges that come with achieving such a high level of celebrity status, and the ways in which Pele navigated those challenges throughout his life.

So sit back, grab your favorite beverage, and join us as we explore the fascinating world of Pele the footballer: from zero to hero, and beyond.
# Chapter 8 Challenge: Pele's Family Tree

Welcome to the challenge section of Chapter 8: Personal Life and Celebrity Status. In this challenge, we will take a closer look at the family tree of the one and only Pele.

Pele's personal life is just as fascinating and inspiring as his football career, and his family played a significant role in shaping the person he became.

To complete this challenge, you will create a program that generates a family tree for Pele, starting with his parents, Dondinho and Celeste Arantes. Your program should list the names of Pele's siblings, spouse, and children, along with any other significant family members.

Your tree should be in a simple text-based format and should show the relationship between each family member. You can use any programming language of your choice.

Here is a sample tree to get you started:

```
|_ Dondinho (father)
|  |_ Pele (son)
|      |_ Edinho (son)
|
|_ Celeste Arantes (mother)
   |_ Pele (son)
       |_ Joshua (son)
       |_ Kelly Cristina (daughter)
       |_ Flavia Christina (daughter)
```

Good luck, and have fun!
The challenge for Chapter 8 asks us to create a program that generates a family tree for Pele, the famous footballer. The program must list his parents, siblings, spouse, and children, along with other significant family members.

To solve this challenge, we can use a simple text-based approach to display the family tree. We will create a function that takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns a formatted string that represents that person and their relationship to Pele.

```python
def generate_tree(name):
    if name == "Dondinho":
        return "|_ Dondinho (father)\n" \
               "|  |_ Pele (son)\n" \
               "|      |_ Edinho (son)\n"
    elif name == "Celeste Arantes":
        return "|_ Celeste Arantes (mother)\n" \
               "   |_ Pele (son)\n" \
               "       |_ Joshua (son)\n" \
               "       |_ Kelly Cristina (daughter)\n" \
               "       |_ Flavia Christina (daughter)\n"
    elif name == "Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi":
        return "|_ Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi (spouse)\n" \
               "   |_ Joshua (son)\n" \
               "   |_ Celeste (daughter)\n" \
               "   |_ Sandra (daughter)\n"
    else:
        return "Invalid name."
```

In this function, we are using if-else statements to check the name of the family member and return a formatted string that represents that person's relationship to Pele.

We start with Pele's father, Dondinho, who is listed at the top of the tree. We use the pipe and underscore characters to create the branches of the tree, with one branch leading down to Pele and another branch leading to Edinho, Pele's brother.

Next, we have Pele's mother, Celeste Arantes, who is listed below Dondinho. We create a longer branch for Celeste since she has more children than Dondinho. From Celeste, we have branches leading to Pele and his three siblings: Joshua, Kelly Cristina, and Flavia Christina.

Finally, we have Pele's spouse, Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi, who is listed at the bottom of the tree. We create a shorter branch since she has fewer children than Celeste. From Rosemeri, we have branches leading to Pele's three children with her: Joshua, Celeste, and Sandra.

Overall, this program provides a simple yet effective way to generate a family tree for Pele.
