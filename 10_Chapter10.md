# Chapter 10: Injuries and Setbacks

_"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." - Nelson Mandela_

As we saw in the previous chapter, Pele had a remarkable performance in the 1962 World Cup, leading Brazil to its second triumph in the tournament. However, even the greatest players are not immune to injuries and setbacks.

Throughout his career, Pele had to deal with various injuries that threatened to end his football journey. From hamstring strains to broken bones, he faced adversity multiple times. But what sets Pele apart is his resilience and determination to never give up on his dreams and overcome any obstacle in his way.

In this chapter, we will explore the injuries and setbacks that Pele encountered during his football career. We will also hear from special guest Neymar Jr., who, like Pele, faced his fair share of injuries and setbacks but used them as motivation to come back stronger than ever before.

Join us as we delve into the world of injuries and setbacks in the football industry and learn how Pele and Neymar Jr. overcame them using their sheer will and perseverance.

Let's get started!

## Overcoming Adversity with Neymar Jr.

To gain further insight into the world of injuries and setbacks, we are thrilled to have a special guest: Neymar Jr., one of the most prominent football players of our time.

Neymar Jr. has faced his fair share of injuries and setbacks, but he never lost sight of his passion for football. He has always been determined to come back stronger after injuries and prove his worth on the field.

In this chapter, we will dive into the injuries that both Pele and Neymar Jr. encountered during their football careers. We will explore how they dealt with these setbacks, what they learned from them, and how they motivated themselves to continue playing the sport they love.

Join us as we learn from two of the most inspiring players in football history and discover the true meaning of overcoming adversity. Let's lace up our shoes and get started!
To address the issue of injuries and setbacks in football, we can use various techniques to prevent injuries and promote recovery. One such technique is strength and conditioning, which involves training the body to handle the stresses that come with football.

Here is an example of strength and condition exercises that can be used to help prevent injuries and promote recovery for football players:

```python
from random import randint

# Warm-up exercises to prevent injuries
def warm_up():
  # Jogging
  for i in range(randint(5, 10)):
    print("Jogging for 1 minute...")

  # Dynamic stretches
  for i in range(10):
    print("Doing dynamic stretches...")

# Strength training exercises to promote recovery
def strength_training():
  # Squats
  reps = randint(8, 12)
  weight = randint(50, 100)
  for i in range(reps):
    print(f"Squatting {weight} lbs for {i+1} rep...")

  # Deadlifts
  reps = randint(8, 12)
  weight = randint(100, 200)
  for i in range(reps):
    print(f"Deadlifting {weight} lbs for {i+1} rep...")

  # Bench press
  reps = randint(8, 12)
  weight = randint(75, 150)
  for i in range(reps):
    print(f"Bench pressing {weight} lbs for {i+1} rep...")

# Cool-down exercises to prevent injuries
def cool_down():
  # Static stretches
  for i in range(10):
    print("Doing static stretches...")

  # Walking
  for i in range(randint(5, 10)):
    print("Walking for 1 minute...")

# Example workout routine
print("Starting workout...\n")
warm_up()
print("\nStarting strength training...\n")
strength_training()
print("\nStarting cool-down...\n")
cool_down()
print("\nWorkout complete!")
```

This code simulates a workout routine that football players can use to prevent injuries and promote recovery. The `warm_up()` function includes jogging and dynamic stretches to prepare the body for the workout. The `strength_training()` function includes exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses to strengthen the muscles and promote recovery. The `cool_down()` function includes static stretches and walking to cool down the body after the workout.

By incorporating these exercises into their training regimen, football players can reduce their risk of injuries and recover faster from setbacks.
