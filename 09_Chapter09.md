# Chapter 9: The 1962 World Cup

Welcome to the ninth chapter of our book on the legendary footballer, Pele. In this chapter, we will delve into the 1962 World Cup, a defining moment in Pele's career.

After a disappointing end to the 1958 World Cup, Pele and the Brazilian team were determined to come back stronger. They faced some early setbacks, as Pele suffered an injury early in the tournament, but the rest of the team rose to the challenge. 

Pele, however, did not let his injury stop him. He recovered quickly and returned to the team with a vengeance, scoring in the quarterfinals and semifinals to lead Brazil to the final against Czechoslovakia. 

The game was a tough one, with both teams fighting hard to come out on top. Pele played a vital role in Brazil's success, scoring the first goal and helping his team secure a 3-1 victory and their second straight World Cup title. 

Pele's performance in the tournament was nothing short of spectacular, proving his worth as one of the best players in the world. It was a moment in time that cemented his place in football history.

In the next section, we will explore Pele's continued success in his career, and his legacy as a hero to many. Stay tuned!
# Pele the Footballer: Zero to Hero - Chapter 9 Exercise 

Congratulations on reaching the ninth chapter of our book on Pele's incredible rise to fame. In this exercise, we will be exploring Pele's performance in the 1962 World Cup, and testing your coding skills by challenging you to develop a small program that will calculate Pele's statistics from the tournament.

Using Python as your programming language of choice, write a program that takes the number of games Pele played, the number of goals he scored, and the number of assists he made in the 1962 World Cup. The program should then use this data to calculate Pele's average goals per game, average assists per game, and his overall contribution to his team.

Once you have written your program, test it with sample data to ensure that it functions correctly. You can use the following statistics for Pele in the 1962 World Cup as a guide:

- Number of games played: 4
- Number of goals scored: 2
- Number of assists: 1

We hope that this exercise helps you gain a deeper understanding of Pele's incredible performance in the 1962 World Cup and provides an opportunity to practice your coding skills. Good luck!
# Explanation of the Code Used to Solve the Chapter 9 Exercise

To solve the Chapter 9 exercise on calculating Pele's statistics from the 1962 World Cup, we can write a Python program that takes the number of games played, the number of goals scored, and the number of assists made as inputs. The program can then use this data to calculate Pele's average goals per game, average assists per game, and his overall contribution to his team.

Let's take a closer look at the code used to solve this exercise.

```
games_played = int(input("Enter the number of games Pele played in the 1962 World Cup: "))
goals_scored = int(input("Enter the number of goals Pele scored in the 1962 World Cup: "))
assists_made = int(input("Enter the number of assists Pele made in the 1962 World Cup: "))

avg_goals_per_game = goals_scored / games_played
avg_assists_per_game = assists_made / games_played
total_contribution = (goals_scored + assists_made) / games_played

print("Pele's average goals per game in the 1962 World Cup were: ", avg_goals_per_game)
print("Pele's average assists per game in the 1962 World Cup were: ", avg_assists_per_game)
print("Pele's total contribution to his team during the 1962 World Cup was: ", total_contribution)
```

The code first prompts the user to input the number of games Pele played, the number of goals he scored, and the number of assists he made in the 1962 World Cup. This is done using the `input()` function and then converting the value to an `int`.

Next, the code calculates Pele's average goals per game and average assists per game using the formulas `goals_scored / games_played` and `assists_made / games_played`, respectively.

Finally, the code calculates Pele's total contribution to his team by adding the number of goals scored and assists made, and dividing by the total number of games played.

The `print()` function is used to display the results of the calculations to the user.

We hope this breakdown of the code used to solve the Chapter 9 exercise is helpful in understanding how to calculate Pele's statistics from the 1962 World Cup using Python.
